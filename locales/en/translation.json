      "title": "Forensic analysis of encrypted SMB traffic",
      "description": "In my bachelor's thesis, I am investigating what forensic insights can be gained from encrypted Server Message Block traffic, even if the user data is not accessible. This involves analysing how metadata (packet sizes, timestamps or connection duration) can be used to draw conclusions about content or behaviour. Various methods, including statistical analyses, rule-based heuristics and machine learning, are being examined for their applicability.",

Malicious software packages are automatically collected from various sources, analysed and added to the collection. The framework automates collection processes, executes analysis pipelines and facilitates the continuous expansion of the collection.",
